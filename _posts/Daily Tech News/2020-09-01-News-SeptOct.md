## [September 1st, 2020]

##  Amazon's surveillance can boost output and possibly limit unions: study
- **Who:**  Amazon
- **What:**  Through an increasing surveillance, the company aims to boost employee output and potentially limit unionization efforts around the United State.
- **Why:**  To track employees and maintain a healthy workforce, and also to track time they spend working as more people telecommute. In addition, amazon uses the data to support people who are not performing to the levels expected with dedicated coaching to help them improve.
- **How:**  
  - Amazon uses such tools as navigation software, item scanners, wristbands, thermal cameras, security cameras and recorded footage to surveil its workforce in warehouses and stores.
  - The data creates heat maps and uses data such as team-member sentiment and a diversity index to figure out which of its stores may have a higher risk of unionizing.
- **So?:**
  - This can have an impact on workers’ ability to advocate for better working conditions and push for collective action.
  - However, the director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute (OMI) claims that company should prohibit extensive surveillance, and if they have to, they need to obtain approval from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).

##  Bermuda Dives Deeper Into Crypto With Stimulus Coin Test Program
- **Who:**  British overseas territory, Bermuda
- **What:**  
  - Is testing a stimulus stablecoin to embrace cryptocurrencies, which can be used to buy food and other essentials.

- **When:**  The pilot program started in July, and is still an ongoing project.
- **Why:**  
  - The coin, created by the Stablehouse coin clearing firm, was designed to be used by businesses the government wants to help.

- **How:**  The country is accepting tax payments and fees in another stablecoin, along the basic shopping -  it is seeking to expand the usage within the country.
- **So?:**  It’s also looking at using so-called decentralized finance applications to provide easier access to loans for its residents.

- **When:**  The company is expected to deliver the satellites for launch by fall 2022.
- **Why:**  As the environmental issues are becoming more important, there is no reusable satellite yet - Hence SpaceX aims to develop further.
- **How:**  Under the SDA contract, SpaceX will use its Starlink assembly plant in Redmond, Washington, to build four satellites fitted with a wide-angle infrared missile-tracking sensor supplied by a subcontractor.
- **So?:**  If it goes to success, it will generate enough revenue to help fund SpaceX’s interplanetary goals. In addition, it will meet the ever-growing need of sustainability.

##  Trends Continue to Push Processing to the Edge for AI
- **Who:**  The technology markets
- **What:**  In recent years, edge computing architecture has moved to the fore, to accommodate the proliferation of data and devices as well as the velocity at which this data is moving. More tech giants are moving towards the edge computing market.

##  Google reveals Mineral crop-inspecting robots
- **Who:**  Google's parent company, Alphabet
- **What:**  They have unveiled prototype robots that can inspect individual plants in a field, to help farmers improve crop yields.
- **When:**  The development is on the go, but there is no explicit timeline or plan to release the buggy as a commercial product.
- **Why:**  The team says its main goal is to address the world's increasing need for food and the sustainability of growing it - but the current tools dont allow farmers to do so.
- **How:**  
  - The robot buggies roll through fields on upright pillars, gathering high quality images of each plant and counting and classifying crops. It can also record information such as plant height, leaf area and fruit size.
  - And all that data is plugged into a machine-learning system to try to spot patterns and insights useful to farmers.
- **So?:**  It will be able to collect huge amounts of data about how crops grow. But the data security is essential at every step, Ian Drew, a technology company founder and chairman said, "because the last thing you want to do is have somebody hijack your farm".

- **When:**  13th of October, 2020
- **Why:**  
  - Darkside hackers claim to have extorted millions of dollars from companies, but say they now want to "make the world a better place".
  - Cyber-security analysts say that the intention of the hacking is unclear - maybe to assuage their guilt, or perhaps they want to be perceived as Robin Hood-like characters.  
- **How:**   The hackers claim they only target large profitable companies with their ransomware attacks. The attacks hold organisations' IT systems hostage until a ransom is paid.
  - They have used a US-based service called The Giving Block, which provides tax incentives by accepting crypto-currency donations.
- **So?:**  
  - The charity, Children International has no intention of keeping the donation if it is linked to a hacker. Moreover, the Water Project, which works to improve access to clean water in sub-Saharan Africa, has not responded to requests for comment.
  - The Giving Block, which is also an advocate for crypto-currencies, added: "The fact they used crypto will make it easier, not harder, to catch them."

##  Police are using facial recognition for minor crimes
- **Who:**  Cities all across the US
- **What:**  Facial recognition has different regulations across the cities in the US as there are no government measures. As facial recognition continues to grow, it's being routinely deployed for everything from shoplifting to graffiti.

- **Why:**  
  - Because of privacy and the intrusiveness of a facial recognition, there's debate among technology companies, lawmakers and civil rights groups on where to draw the line.
  - However, when it's able to be used without limits by police departments, the technology increases the chances of mistakes and threatens privacy.
- **How:**  Portland, Oregon are only limiting the use of facial recognition from police use, whereas police in New York have been able to use the technology for crimes like shoplifting.
- **So?:**  Some argue that there should be a full ban of the technology to prevent the potential false arrests, while some argues to limit facial recognition to serious felonies as it could damage people's privacy in the long run.
