- **When:**  3rd of December, 2020
- **Why:**  Because the 5G communications will allow producers to improve crops through the collection of information by sensors placed in the fields - by sensors placed in the fields, on harvesters and drones, so that it can be readily crossed with meteorological and humidity data.
- **How:**  
  - Combining fast broadband communications with real time cloud data processing will give farmers the information so they can rapidly take actions against diseases and other threats to their crops.
  - The pilot was launched in the soy-farming town of Rio Verde, and uses a 5G network built by telecom company Claro, a unit of Mexico’s América Móvil.
- **So?:**  Brazil’s government decided not to ban the use of Huawei equipment in next year’s auction of 5G frequencies spectrum; telecommunications regulator Anatel has proposed rules that do not exclude the Chinese Company.

##  Art in the age of machine intelligence By media artist Refik Anadol
- The talk explores the melding of **art with artificial intelligence**, delivered by a media artist Refik Anadol.
- He claims: Data can only become knowledge when it's experienced, and knowledge and experience can take many forms.

**Project 1: Archive Dreaming**
- One of the first AI-driven public installations in the world, exploring approximately 1.7 million documents that span 270 years.
- The resulting work was a user-driven immersive space that challenges immutable concepts of the archive, while destabilizing archive-related questions with machine learning algorithms.

**Project 3: Ted talk Archive**
- They collected 7705 ted talks, extracted 487,168 sentences, to further extract into 330 unique clusters of topics like nature, global emissions, extinction, computation and etc.
- These clusters are then connected to each other by an algorithm, that generated 113 million line segments, which reveal new conceptual relationships.
- The result is a space where you interact with various feelings attributed to learning, remembering, questioning and imagining all at the same time, expanding the power of the mind.
