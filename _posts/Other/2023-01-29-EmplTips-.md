### Aim
- The aim of the project 

### Objectives
- 💡 
- Why? 

| Don't | Do |
|--|--|
| Academically research and review the existing architecture. | Identify the key issues in relation to edge computing performance.|

- Do you recognize the difference here?
- You can't measure if you've done the job with the first objective. Whereas, for the latter, there are going to be issues that you have clearly identified.


### Deliverables
- It 


### Tasks, Milestones and Timeline
- I combined these three into one section - simply said, I have:
1. Gantt chart
2. Step by step explanation of each step of the Gantt chart
3. Identified the milestones from 2.


#### Tasks and Timeline
- This


#### Milestones
- 💡 


### Risk Assessment
```
Risk = Likelihood * Impact.
```
- It is less likely
