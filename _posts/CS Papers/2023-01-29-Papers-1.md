## Recommender system
- Recommender System is an information filtering system that aims at predicting the preference of rating given to an item by any user, thereby helping users make personalised decision.
- The paper discusses various approaches used in the various recommender systems such as Content based, Collaborative and Hybrid recommender system.   
- It also proposes main challenges and the solutions to these recommendation techniques.

## Breeds of Recommender System

| Recommender                         | Description | Advantages | Disadvantages |   
| -----------                         | ------------------ | ----------- | ----------- |  
| **Content-based Filtering Systems** | - Uses information of active users and data about the items. <br> **Steps:** 1. Gathers content data about the item( author, cost, i.e. metadata)<br>2. Process data and extract useful features and elements. | - Doesn’t require data of other users.  <br> - Has capabilities of recommending items to user with unique taste. | Items are limited to their initial descriptions or features. |
| **Collaborative Filtering Systems** | - Uses information about a set of users and their relations with the item to provide recommendations to the active user. <br> - Based on a few customers who are most similar to the active users - uses Cosine Similarity. <br> **1. User Based CF:** For each user, compute correlation with other users. For each item, aggregate the rating of the users highly correlated with each user. <br> **2. Item-based CF:** For each item, compute correlation with other items. For each user, aggregate his rating of the items highly correlated with each item. | Doesn’t need a representation of items. | The item can’t be recommended to any user until and unless the item is either rated by another user(s) or correlated with other similar items.|
| **Demographic Filtering Systems**   | - Uses demographic information such as age, gender, education, etc. of people for identifying types of user. <br> - Uses pre-existing knowledge of demographic information about the users and their opinions | - Doesn't require history of user ratings. <br> - Quick, easy and a straightforward method based on few observations | - Recommendations are stereotypical, as it depends on the assumption that users belong to a certain category. <br> - Security and privacy issues. |
| **Hybrid recommender Systems**      | - Uses a combination of two or more different recommendation techniques. <br> - Uses both item content and the ratings of all users. | Can overcome various problems caused by a single recommender system | Can be complex to implement as the hybridisation method needs to be chosen carefully. |
